# Extra-Functions
1.8.9 Minecraft Utility Mod
This mod is extremely WIP, I would probably class it as Pre-Alpha, it's my first mod as well, so the codes probably a little scruffy!

Any contributions would be greatly appreciated in the form of a pull request, try to make your changes clear where possible.
